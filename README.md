Socket Saturation
=================

I currently work with distributed databases which use HTTP requests to perform actions (like ElasticSearch).

On a server, I receive an error about cURL which can't assign the request address:

```
[curl] 7: Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1: Can't assign requested address [url] http://127.0.0.1:9200
````

This error was thrown directly by the PHP cURL extension and not by my code... After some search, I found that it is possible my code take all socket possibilities on the system and then the error appear.

For this project I use [Guzzle](http://guzzlephp.org/) as my favourite PHP Client but it seems to have a little problem with a lot of quick calls...

I create this repo to present the problem and illustrate with some stats.
